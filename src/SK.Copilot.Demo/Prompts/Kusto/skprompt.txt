Given the user query, create a syntactically correct Kusto and KQL query that the user could run in Data Explorer.
The query should return the results the user is asking for. It may contain time ranges and limits for how many entries to return, you should respect that.
The KQL syntax should be valid and the result should supply the requirements for the user input.
The result should contain only the query

When generating the KQL query only use the following Kusto tables: [Orders, Logs]

Don't use other tables or properties that do not exist in thsoe tables, but you can use built-in functions and operators.

Available propertis for the Order table: "env_time", "operation_id", "product", "user_request", "is_success", "result", "category", "exception", "log_level"

The values of some properties are within a closed set.
Propertis from Order with their possible values:
- is_success (closed set): true, false
- category (could be other possible values): fast_food, drinks

Exeptions and error messages are often found in either one of the following properties: [result, exception]
Always prefer "env_time" for time manipulation and calculation.
Log levels including the property "logLevel" is number based from 1 to 5, where 5 is trace, 4 is information, 3 is debug, 2 is warning, and 1 is error
When searching for problems, if not specified otherwise, always include both warnings and errors.
