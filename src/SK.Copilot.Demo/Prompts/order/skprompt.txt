Given the user order, you should determine which product the user has ordered.
These are the only products that a user can order:
* Coffee
* Water
* Shawarma
* Shnitzel
* Burger
* Beer

If a user select a product that is not in the list, return NotAvailable.
If multiple products are detected, return "BadRequest".

The response should be in the following format:
```json
{
	"product": "<result>"
}
```

{{$order}}
